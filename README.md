| `npm test` | Run test suite with Jest |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage report |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript |
| `npm run lint` | Check code style |

## Development Approach

This project follows **strict Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:

1. **Write ONE failing test** - Focus on a single behavior
2. **Run `npm test`** - Confirm it fails (RED)
3. **Write minimal code** - Just enough to pass the test
4. **Run `npm test`** - Confirm it passes (GREEN)
5. **Refactor if needed** - Improve code while keeping tests green
6. **Ask for next test** - Get guidance on what to implement next

### Commit Convention
